## Abstract
The advancement of networking and sensor-enabled devices have motivated the emergence of unprecedented initiatives, 
including Industry 4.0 and smart cities. Those are entwined in a way that makes their operation duly interconnected. 
Industry 4.0 will sooner become the biggest consumer of smart city big data. That data is geo-referenced, and its storage and processing need spatial-awareness, 
which is currently absent within the constellation of biggest big data management players of the market. We aim to fill this gap by providing spatial-aware big data management 
strategies in support for Industry 4.0 main principles. Our experimental results show that our strategies outperform those of state-of-the-art by orders of magnitude.
