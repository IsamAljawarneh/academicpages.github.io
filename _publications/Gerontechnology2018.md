## Abstract
The SACHER project provides a distributed, open source and federated cloud platform able to support the life-cycle management of various kinds of data concerning tangible Cultural Heritage. The paper describes the SACHER platform and, in particular, among the various integrated service prototypes, the most important ones to support restoration processes and cultural asset management:(i) 3D Life Cycle Management for Cultural Heritage (SACHER 3D CH), based on 3D digital models of architecture and dedicated to the management of Cultural Heritage and to the storage of the numerous data generated by the team of professionals involved in the restoration process;(ii) Multidimensional Search Engine for Cultural Heritage (SACHER MuSE CH), an advanced multi-level search system designed to manage Heritage data from heterogeneous sources.
