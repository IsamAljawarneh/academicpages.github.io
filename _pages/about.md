# Research Interests
* Middleware for dynamic and adaptive services in big data management scenarios. Specifically, I am interested in working with spatiotemporal and time-series IoT data
* Processing of highly burst data streaming workloads with guarantees of Quality of Service. Specifically, for spatially-tagged and temporal big datasets.
* Context-aware computing. For example, context-aware recommender systems based on latest trending Deep Learning models.
* Stream-static join processing for dynamic big data scenarios including smart cities, Industry 4.0 and industrial IoT (IIoT)..
* Distributed Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) processing
* [Here](http://IsamAljawarneh.github.io/files/research_statement_Aljawarneh.pdf) my research statement.
