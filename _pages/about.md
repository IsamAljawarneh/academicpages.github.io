# Research Topics
* Middleware for dynamic and adaptive services in big data management scenarios. Specifically, I am interested in working with spatiotemporal and time-series IoT data
* Processing of highly burst data streaming workloads with guarantees of Quality of Service. Specifically, for spatially-tagged and temporal big datasets.
* Context-aware computing. For example, context-aware recommender systems based on latest trending Deep Learning models.
* Stream-static join processing for dynamic big data scenarios including smart cities, Industry 4.0 and industrial IoT (IIoT)..
* Distributed Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) processing

# Research Activities
* **March 2020 - present**: Postdoctoral Fellow at the Departament of Computer Science and Engineering.
  * **Supervisor**: [Professor Rebecca Montanari](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/rebecca.montanari/cv-en).
  * **Team**: [Mobile Middleware Research Group](https://middleware.unibo.it/) in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it/it/) at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en).
   * **Project**: Design of scalable processing system for cultural heritage data relating. As part of the PON "RESEARCH AND INNOVATION" 2014 - 2020- IDEHA, CUP J46C18000440008.
  * **A brief**: I am responsible for designing highly-available and industry-grade prototype for efficiently managing geo-referenced human and vehicle mobility time-series data. I am designing novel indexing, partitioning and query processing algorithms that are aware of the multidimensional nature and shape of mobility data (three dimensions, spatial, temporal, and contextual). The novel contribution is the design of Cloud-based algorithms that operate on the confluence between spatial and time-series data. Most methods of the relevant art are operating in one of the two modes (either spatial or time-series) but applications of both together remain humble. Methods that I am developing will be able to achieve both spatial and temporal awareness synergistically. A probable scenario would be modelling how my support can be used to distribute tourist people around archeological sites in a proper manner to avoid crowd and to maintain safety.

  * **Brief**: Huge amounts of georeferenced data streams are arriving daily to data stream management systems that are deployed for serving highly scalable and dynamic applications. There are innumerable ways at which those loads can be exploited to gain deep insights in various domains. Decision makers require an interactive visualization of such data in the form of maps and dashboards for decision making and strategic planning. Data streams normally exhibit fluctuation and oscillation in arrival rates and skewness. Those are the two predominant factors that greatly impact the overall quality of service. This requires data stream management systems to be attuned to those factors in addition to the spatial shape of the data that may exaggerate the negative impact of those factors. Current systems do not natively support services with quality guarantees for dynamic scenarios, leaving the handling of those logistics to the user which is challenging and cumbersome. Three workloads are predominant for any data stream, batch processing, scalable storage and stream processing. In this thesis, we have designed a quality of service aware system, SpatialDSMS, that constitutes several subsystems that are covering those loads and any mixed load that results from intermixing them. Most importantly, we natively have incorporated quality of service optimizations for processing avalanches of geo-referenced data streams in highly dynamic application scenarios. This has been achieved transparently on top of the codebases of emerging de facto standard best-in-class representatives, thus relieving the overburdened shoulders of the users in the presentation layer from having to reason about those services. Instead, users express their queries with quality goals and our system optimizers compiles that down into query plans with an embedded quality guarantee and leaves logistic handling to the underlying layers. We have developed standard compliant prototypes for all the subsystems that constitutes SpatialDSMS. Thereafter, we have tested with huge amounts of real and synthetic geo-referenced datasets, deploying our computing clusters in-house and in Cloud computing environments. Our results show that all the subsystems of SpatialDSMS were able to achieve the envisaged quality goals and outperform baselines by significant margins.
